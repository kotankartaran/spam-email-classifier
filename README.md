# 📧 Spam Email Classifier

A Machine Learning project that detects whether an email or SMS message is **Spam** or **Legitimate (Ham)** using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and the Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

Spam messages are one of the most common problems in digital communication. This project uses Machine Learning and NLP techniques to automatically classify messages as:

- ✅ Legitimate (Ham)
- 🚨 Spam

The model is trained on the SMS Spam Collection Dataset and deployed using Streamlit for an interactive user experience.
